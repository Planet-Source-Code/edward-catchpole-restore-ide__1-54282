## Restore IDE


</div>

### Description

If you have worked with fullscreen DirectX, then you'll know that when you end your program, the VB IDE is all messed up, in the wrong place of the screen etc, and you have to minimize then restore it to get it back to it's original state.

I got tired sick of having to do this so I created this simple little add-in which will detect when your program ends and automatically restore the IDE to the state it was in before.

To use it, simply compile and place in your main VB program folder (usually: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VB98\), then open VB again, goto Add-Ins > Add-In Manager, and double click on "Ed's Restore IDE" to load it for the first time and you're done!
